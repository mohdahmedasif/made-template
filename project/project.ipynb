    "\r\n",
    "We collected and preprocessed data from three main sources: stock price data, social media posts, and news articles. The aim was to prepare the data for further analysis and integration. Sentiment analysis was performed on social media data and news articles using natural language processing techniques. This involved assessing the sentiment expressed in each text data point, classifying it as positive, negative, or neutral. The sentiment data derived from social media and news were integrated with the stock price data. This step aimed to establish correlations between sentiments and stock price movements. Statistical analysis and modeling techniques were applied to quantify the impact of socind applicability in real-world trading scenarios. in real-world trading scenarios."
